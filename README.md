# Tetriband
A tetris game watchface game for the mi band 7

### Installation

Download the latest release here: https://github.com/Nadeflore/tetriband/releases

Install it like any normal watchface

### How to play

To start the game, tap the bottom of the screen.

The game displays a pause menu when suspended during a game. From here you can display controls help.

The button at the bottom of the screen works like this :

- Short press : soft drop
- Long press : hard drop

I tried to optimize it the best I could, but performance can be slow sometimes, especially when the screen is filled with blocks.
I found the going to the watchface selection screen and going back can sometimes improve performance.

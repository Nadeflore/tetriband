# tetriband
A tetris game watchface game for the mi band 7

To start the game, tap the bottom of the screen.

The game displays a pause menu when suspended during a game. From here you can display controls help.

The button at the bottom of the screen works like this :
short press : soft drop
long press : hard drop

I tried to optimize it the best I could, but performance can be slow sometimes, especially when the screen is filled with blocks. I found the going to the watchface selection screen and going back can improve performance.
